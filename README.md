## Roadmap

Features planned:
* Improved privacy mode that can be enabled for domain names (e.g Google)
* Split browsing (screen will be splitted to two like in tiling window managers)
* Auto-search: automatically bringing results from search engines -in privacy mode- to the menu, so user doesn't have to open them.

Known issues:
* Multiple windows share same tabbing session.
* There is bugs with tabbing behavior.
* Back/forward buttons should update immediately after url changes

Improvements:
* 


* UX

* Privacy
